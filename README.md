# Cryptocurrency-Visualiser


This repository has been pre-configured with a .gitignore and .gitattributes file specific to Unity projects using git-lfs. 

This project was created for Unity [2021.3.4f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

The project has been created with a barebones folder structure.  The settings have been optimized for best 3D quality without adding any additional packages to the project.
For 2D projects, go to Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor and set the "Default Behaviour Mode" to 2D.  Do this at the start so that imported assets are optimized automatically.

This project is designed to gather cryptocurrency prices from the internet using CryptoCompare's API and the UnityWebRequest module.
The Project will change the size of coins depending on price and allow users to compare the prices of cryptos visually.
